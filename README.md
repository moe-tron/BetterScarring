# BetterScarring
Reworks scarring in rimworld somewhat.

I always found it unrealistic how scars were so debilitating in rimworld, as someone with a massive scar I rarely notice it at all.
I also found that it was relatively hard for scars to show up at all outside of pawn generation. My pawn could get like 20 cuts and none of them result in a scar.

This mod adjusts some stuff related to scarring and makes it configurable to your playstyle.

Features:

  - Scarring is more common but also less severe: Scars on external parts such as arms, legs, hands, etc. can now only have the pain category of itchy or no pain. The severity of these scars are also greatly reduced as well.
  - High quality tending has a chance to prevent an injury from becoming permanent.
  - Entirely configurable, you can change the chance for injuries to become permanent as well as the ratio of the initial injury severity to the max permanent severity.
  - Permanent injuries on body parts that are either delicate (eyes, brain) or not skin covered (organs, ribs, other bones) remain unchanged.
  - Changes how some pawns perceive scarred / disfigured pawns. Certain traits / ideos / precepts will either view scars as honorable or not care at all.

Compatibility:

  - Should work with all mods unless they also try to patch scarring / permanent damage. I don't think many mods do this though.
  - Mods that add permanent damage types that are meant to be severe on non-delicate skin covered body parts might get nerfed.
