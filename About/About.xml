  <description>
Makes pawns getting scarred from injuries on external body parts more common but also less severe.

Permanent injuries on delicate or internal body parts remain just as severe as before.

Certain Pawns will also not get the negative "disfigured" opinion of scarred pawns. Some may also get a bonus opinion depending on their traits / ideology.
