This mod re-works scarring some and makes it somewhat more realistic.

Why I made this:
  - Scarring in rimworld on non-delicate parts is actually pretty uncommon outside of pawn generation except for very severe injuries. In real life you can get a scar from something as simple as falling off a bike.
  - When scarring does happen it's ridiculously severe; why should a scar render a Pawn's arm almost useless? As someone with a massive scar I rarely ever notice it.

Features:
  - Permanent injuries on skin-covered non-delicate body parts are much more common but less severe.
  - Permanent injuries on delicate or non skin-covered body parts should remain the same.
  - Reworks how the "disfigured" thought works, now certain kinds of pawns like scarring on other pawns depending on their traits / ideology.
  - Adds a chance for good tends to prevent an injury from becoming permanent.
  - Configurable letting you set the chance that an injury becomes permanent (if it's possible for it to) as well as the ratio for the initial severity to the permanent severity.

Known issues:
  - Scars that are generated on Pawn generation will stil be relatively severe. I'm not sure if I'm going to try and change that yet.

Compatability:
  - Should be compatible with all mods.
  - Should be compatible with added body parts as long as they're setup correctly.
  - Might not work as intended with damage types that have permanent damage types that are meant to be seriously debilitating - worst case is that the permanent injuries won't be as bad as intended.
